\title{Summarize bulk RNA counts with metadata}
\usage{
bulk_counts_summary_dt(counts_path, meta_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts_path}{Path to CSV file with columns: gene, sample_id, count.}

\item{meta_path}{Path to CSV file with columns: sample_id, condition, batch, patient ID, timepoint.}
}
\value{
List with: filtered_data, gene_mean_median, gene_condition_means
\itemize{
  \item gene_mean_median: Mean and median counts by gene (treated only)
  \item gene_condition_means: Mean counts by gene and condition
}
}
\description{
This function reads in raw bulk RNA-seq counts and metadata,
it merges bulk RNA-seq count data with sample metadata by "sample_id",
filters treated samples whose gene names start with "GENE_00",
and computes multiple summary statistics:
mean/median counts per gene as well as per-condition mean counts.
Designed for quick quality control and exploratory summaries using data.table's fast aggregation capabilities.
