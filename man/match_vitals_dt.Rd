\title{Nearest-time matching of vitals and labs}
\usage{
match_vitals_dt(labs_path, vitals_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{labs_path}{Path to CSV file with columns: patient_id, time_iso, lab, value.}

\item{vitals_path}{Path to CSV file with columns: time_iso}
}
\value{
List with labs_with_vitals and correlations (CRP vs HR/SBP)
}
\description{
Matches nearest HR/SBP readings, vital signs, to each lab time and computes correlations.
}
\details{
Performs "rolling join" to match the closest available heart rate (HR)
and systolic blood pressure (SBP) to each lab test times for the same patient.
Computes per-patient correlations between CRP (C-reactive protein) and vitals.
