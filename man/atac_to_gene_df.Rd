\title{Map ATAC-seq peaks to genes using genomic overlaps}
\usage{
atac_to_gene_df(peaks_path, genes_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{peaks_path}{Path to CSV file with columns: chr, start, end, peak_id, score}

\item{genes_path}{Path to CSV file with columns: chr, start, end, gene}
}
\value{
none
}
\description{
Uses \code{foverlaps()} to detect overlaps between peak intervals
and gene coordinates, computes overlap lengths, and summarizes
peaks per gene and total overlap length. Returns top 20 genes
with the most total overlapping base pairs.
